        <h1>Fortified Wines</h1>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>Sherry Probably more than any other wine, Sherry is a wine style that is defined by the processes used during maturation. None of the key techniques, the solera system, biological ageing or oxidative ageing, are unique to this region, but it is in Jerez that they are exploited to their fullest extent. The vineyard area surrounds the southern Spanish town of Jerez de la Frontera that gives the region its name. At the time of publication of this book, various legislative changes to DO Jerez were awaiting EU approval. One change will allow the different styles of Sherry wines to be made without fortification providing stylistic parameters, such as alcohol levels and typical aromas, continue to be met. However, this chapter will focus solely on the winemaking processes for fortified wines.</p>

            <p>IN THE VINEYARD Climate and Soils Jerez has a hot, sunny Mediterranean climate although the vineyards that are nearer the coast are on average a little cooler and benefit more from the prevailing cool humid westerly wind known as the poniente. On occasions the temperature can be sent soaring by the hot and drying levante, which blows from the east. This extra heat can seriously stress the vines and damage grapes. Being a coastal region the annual rainfall is high compared with many other Spanish regions, but rainfall in the growing season is limited and it is the albariza soil in the region that ensures the vine can cope.</p>

            <p>Albariza has a very high chalk content. It provides good drainage but vitally its depth and excellent water holding capacity mean that it can store enough water to sustain the vines during the hot dry summers. In order to maximise the amount of water retained by the soil during the autumn and winter, rectangular pits are dug between the rows of vines to trap the water and reduce run-off. This is done once the harvest has finished and the soil is smoothed out again in the spring. Moisture retention is further enhanced during the summer when the albariza soil forms a hard crust that limits evaporation from the soil.</p>

            <p>Grape Varieties The three main grape varieties are: Palomino - This grape accounts for the vast majority of the plantings in Jerez. It produces wines that are naturally low in acid and lack obvious varietal aromas. This makes it ideal for Sherry production where the styles of wine are largely determined by either biological or oxidative maturation Pedro Ximénez (PX) - In common with Palomino, PX has little varietal flavour. Its thin skin makes it ideally suited to being sun dried and consequently it is used in the production of sweet Sherries. There is very little planted in Jerez. Most of the grapes that are used come from the neighbouring region of Montilla-Moriles where it grows more successfully. It is an unusual feature of the regulations that these grapes can be used in the production of Sherry.</p>

            <p>Muscat of Alexandria - Only very small amounts of this are grown and, like PX, it is used to make sweet wines. IN THE WINERY (DRY STYLES) Grape Handling and Fermentation Palomino is used to make the dry wines of Jerez. Given the high temperatures at harvest time, the grapes must reach the press as quickly as possible to avoid oxidation. Fermentation typically takes place in large stainless steel tanks at temperatures ranging from 22°C to 26°C (72°F to 79°F). This is high for a white wine but suits the aim of the Sherry producer who is seeking to produce a neutral base wine. The base wine is dry with approximately 11-12% abv.</p>

            <p>First Classification During the autumn the wines are classified into two types: those that will be sent for biological ageing and those that will be sent for oxidative ageing. These decisions are based on the flavour characteristics of the wines. Typically, lighter paler wines with more 'finesse' are selected for biological ageing and darker, richer 'heavier' wines are selected for oxidative ageing. Note that at this stage the film-forming yeast known as flor will have started to grow on the surface of all the wines The exact criteria for classification will vary according to the house style of the producer but this is not a part of the process that is simply left to chance. Producers need certain volumes of new wines in particular styles in order to meet the sales demands of their brands and classify wines with this in mind. As a simple guide, wines made from grapes grown in the relatively cooler coastal vineyards and/or fermented at lower temperatures are more likely to be suitable for biological ageing. On the other hand, wines made from grapes grown in the warmer inland vineyards and/or fermented at higher temperatures are more likely to be suitable for oxidative ageing.</p>

            <p>Fortification and Sobretabla Once the classification has been made the wines are fortified using a 95% abv neutral spirit. The wines are then set aside for a period of a few months before they are incorporated into a solera system. This stage is known as sobretabla. Wines for biological ageing - These wines are fortified that is suitable for its respective solera system. Wines that fail to make the grade are either refortified and sent for oxidative ageing or rejected altogether. Wines for oxidative ageing - These wines are fortified to 17% abv; at this strength the flor dies. The period of sobretabla is not as critical for the quality of these wines because there is no need to wait and see if flor flavours develop.</p>

            <p>IN THE WINERY (NATURALLY SWEET STYLES) Grape Handling Once picked, the grapes destined for naturally sweet wines are sun-dried to concentrate their sugar levels. This process also develops flavours of raisin. For more information on this technique see section Sweet Winemaking in Chapter 8. Fermentation and Fortification Once the desired must weight is achieved, the grapes are pressed and fermentation started. The grapes yield such a concentrated juice that the yeast struggle to ferment the sugars and rarely manage more than a few degrees of alcohol. Once fermentation has stopped the must is fortified to 17% abv.</p>

            <p>MATURATION IN THE SOLERA SYSTEM Traditionally, legislation has stated that the wines of DO Jerez can only be matured at bodegas within the city limits of Jerez de la Frontera or in the two smaller seaside towns of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa Maria. At the time of publication, changes to this legislation have been proposed that will permit the wines of DO Jerez to be matured at bodegas anywhere within the DO boundaries (with the exception of Fino wines, which cannot be matured in Sanlucar de Barrameda, see section Styles of Sherry). Sherry has to be aged in 600-litre oak barrels called butts. These butts are very old as the flavours of oak are not desirable in these wines. The oak is needed to allow</p>

            <p>oxygen to reach the wine, and this is further encouraged by the fact the butts are only ever five-sixths full. Keeping the maturation environment cool is a particular challenge in Jerez. Traditional bodegas have thick whitewashed walls, high ceilings and windows that point towards the cooling poniente winds helping to maintain a relatively cool environment. The earth floors of these buildings are kept damp to maintain the correct level of humidity. Some are now air-conditioned. The Solera System Sherry is famous for its system of maturation called the used to sustain biological and oxidative ageing.</p>

            <p>to between 15% and 15.5% abv. This is the ideal strength 'solera system. It is a very versatile system that can be for the development of flor. For these wines the period of sobretabla is very important. The producer needs to wait and see if the flor develops correctly on these wines and therefore a second classification is necessary to determine whether the wine has a style and character The solera system is made up of a number of groups of butts, referred to here as levels, which hold wines of different average ages. These levels are called criaderas and the maturation process involves moving wine</p>

To avoid confusion, solera system is used here to refer to the maturation system as a whole while solera is used to refer to the final level in the system that holds wine of the oldest average age. The process can be summarised as follows:</p>

            <p>Wine for bottling is taken out of the solera system from the solera. An equal amount of wine is taken from each butt in this level. The solera is not fully emptied and the butts are replenished with the same volume of wine taken from butts in the next level that contain wine of a slightly conditions is such that the temperature and humidity of an individual bodega and even a butt's position within it can influence the style of the maturing Sherry. Flor cannot thrive in a wine with an abv above 15.5%, and it favours cool to moderate temperatures and high levels of humidity Consequently, flor grows more vigorously in the spring and autumn and dies back in winter and summer.</p>

            <p>The solera system is able to sustain a permanent culture of flor in every butt. The butts are only part filled so that the flor has easy access to oxygen. Importantly, this layer of flor also protects the wine from oxidation. The flor is also constantly consuming alcohol and other nutrients and therefore regular additions of new wine younger average age called the first criadera. There are is needed to keep the flor supplied with these nutrients. three steps involved in this replenishment. An equal volume of wine is taken from each butt in the first criadera. All of the wine taken from the first criadera is then mixed together. Finally this blended wine is used to top up each butt in the solera</p>

            <p>The first criadera is then replenished in exactly the same way with wine from the second criadera and so on, so that each criadera is being replenished in turn with younger wine. .The criadera containing the youngest wine is usually replenished with sobretabla wine. The number of criaderas in the system can vary. As a result of the systematic blending that happens every time wine is moved between the levels of the system, it is only possible to talk about the average age of wines that are taken out for bottling or blending. Although the solera system is complex, the main advantage it offers is that wine taken out of it for bottling or blending is the same every time. It is a feature of the system that the wine introduced into a new level takes on the characteristics of the older wine it has been blended with. However, this consistency cannot be maintained if wine of poor quality is fed into the system in the first place or too much wine is taken out each year. Each criadera and solera is fixed to one solera system. It is convenient to represent a solera system diagrammatically as levels of butts one on top of the other although this is not necessarily how they are stacked in a bodega (warehouse). In order to reduce the risk of losing an entire solera system in one catastrophic event, criaderas from the same solera system are often kept in different buildings.</p>

            <p>Flor and Biological Ageing Biological ageing requires the presence of flor, which is made up of a number of yeast strains. Together these yeast form a thick layer on the surface of the wine. They feed off the alcohol (and other nutrients) in the wine and oxygen in the atmosphere to produce carbon dioxide and acetaldehyde. It is acetaldehyde that gives biologically aged Sherries their unique flavour, In order to thrive, flor needs precise levels of alcohol, temperature and humidity Its sensitivity to the ambient In order to maintain a ready flow of nutrients between the criaderas, wine is drawn off the solera at frequent and regular periods throughout the year. This also best serves the style of wine produced. Biologically aged Sherries, such as Finos, quickly lose their freshness and ideally need to be consumed as soon as possible after bottling. Although it is possible to keep the flor culture alive indefinitely, wine taken from these solera systems rarely has an average age greater than three to four years. As the average age of the wine increases the overall level of nutrients in the oldest criadera and solera drops and by the time the average age reaches seven years the levels are sufficiently low that the flor can start to fail and oxidative characteristics develop.</p>

            <p>Oxidative Ageing Oloroso, PX and some Muscat Sherries are aged oxidatively, without the presence of flor. Amontillado is aged oxidatively after a period of biological ageing. The impact of oxygen on these wines is greatly enhanced by the air present in the part-filled butts. In these solera systems the introduction of young wine helps to preserve the base character of the Sherry, which would otherwise become overly oxidised. A butt containing Foo.

            <h2>Blending And Finishing</h2>
            <p>The advantage of the solera system is that it produces a wine of consistent style and quality. Some Sherries are the product of only one solera system but this is relatively rare. Most Sherries, including many of the very best, are blends of wines from several solera systems. For example, in the case of very old Oloroso this blending can bring together the intense flavours of very old wines, which would be unbalanced on their own, with the freshness of younger wines. The large producers own many different solera systems, giving them wines of different ages and styles that they can use to make up their various blends.</p>

            <p>Most Sherry will undergo fining and filtration prior to bottling. However, in recent years, there has been a growing trend towards keeping these interventions to Final Manzanilla Pale Cream Biologically aged wines a minimum. This is particularly true of biologically aged wines because the vibrancy of their flavours can be dulled by high levels of intervention.</p>

            <h2>Styles Of Sherry</h2>
            <p>Dry Styles Fino and Manzanilla - These wines have only undergone biological ageing. They are pale lemon in colour and usually have aromas of citrus fruit, almonds and herbs, together with bready notes derived from the action of flor. They do not improve in bottle and should be consumed as fresh as possible. Wines that are matured in the coastal town of Sanlúcar de Barrameda qualify as Manzanilla de Sanlúcar de Barrameda, which is a separate DO to that of Jerez. The wines are made in exactly the same way as Finos from Jerez but the cooler more humid conditions on the coast guarantee a thick layer of flor throughout the year. This results in wines that have a more intensely tangy aroma. Manzanilla is most famous for the Fino style wine that is called Manzanilla fina.</p>

            <p>Proposed changes to legislation will lead to the previously unregulated labelling term, en rama, being regulated. It is planned that the term now be reserved for wines that have not been fined or stabilised for tartrates. The wines can be filtered. Oloroso-These wines have only undergone oxidative ageing. They are brown in colour, full-bodied and dominated by oxidative aromas such as toffee, leather, spice and walnut. Very old Olorosos can become very concentrated, and develop an astringency that is balanced when blended with younger wines in the solera system. Amontillado-These are wines that have undergone a period of biological ageing followed by a period of oxidative ageing. Once the flor has died the wines are refortified to 17% abv and fed into an Amontillado solera system. These wines are amber or brown in colour, less full-bodied than Olorosos and combine yeast derived aromas with oxidative aromas, although the yeast aromas slowly fade as the wine ages, they remain recognisable. Amontillados can be matured for as long as Oloroso.</p>

            <p>Palo Cortado - This is a rare style of Sherry It is defined as one that has the aroma character of an Amontillado but the body and richness of an Oloroso. Some producers identify Palo Cortado at the second classification although this is not universally the case. Producers use a variety of different methods to make Paio Cortado. Palo Cortado Sherries can be very difficult to tell apart from both Amontillado and Oloroso Sherries with which they share similar characteristics. Nevertheless they are nearly always wines of very high quality.</p>
