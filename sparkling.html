        <h1>Sparkling Wines</h1>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>Sparkling Wine Production Although they are all fizzy, in a wide range of styles. / sparkling wines are made a of They can be white, red or rosé, come in any level of sweetness, and range in flavour from fresh and fruity through to toasty and nutty. this chapter we will focus on white sparkling wine and the particular grape growing and winemaking chniques that are used. 41 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are also widely planted and both are used for still and sparkling wine production. The still Pinot Noir wines are often medium-bodied with fine tannins and flavours of cherry and cranberry, and as more producers have started to pay attention to this variety, increasingly impressive wines are made. Riesling and Pinot Gris also perform well here.</p>

            <p>Nelson Located to the north-west of the Wairau Valley on the north coast of South Island, Nelson is cooler and wetter than Marlborough. Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris dominate plantings. Canterbury Canterbury has two main centres of viticulture: one in the plain immediately to the west of the town of Christchurch and a larger one, Waipara Valley, to the north. The plain area is particularly exposed to the cooling influence of the Pacific although there is a slight warming effect from north-westerly winds. The impact of these warm winds is more marked in Waipara, which is less exposed to the ocean due to a range of hills. Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir are the most planted varieties, but Waipara is also noted for the high quality of its Riesling.</p>

            <p>Central Otago Central Otago is located inland in the foothills of the Southern New Zealand Alps. The vineyard area itself is spread over a wide area incorporating a number of different valleys with different aspects, soils and altitudes. In contrast to the rest of New Zealand, the climate here is continental and frost damage is a real risk both in spring and autumn. Summers can be warm but, importantly for grape quality, the diurnal range in the growing season is large. The intensity of sunlight is very high, which accounts for the high levels of alcohol that are often encountered in the wines from here Pinot Noir accounts for the vast majority of the plantings in Central Otago, and these wines tend to be full-bodied, juicy and vibrant with concentrated ripe red fruit flavours. The other important varieties are Pinot Gris, Riesling and Chardonnay.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Vineyard</h2>
            <p>The requirements for growing grapes for sparkling wine are quite different from those needed to produce grapes for still wine. First, the grapes should ideally be relatively low in sugar compared with those used for still wines. The second fermentation that gives most sparkling wines their bubbles also increases the alcohol levels of the wines by a further 1.2-1.3% abv. Therefore winemakers will generally aim to produce a still dry base wine with 10-11% abv. Second, high acid levels are desired for many sparkling wines, which are made in a refreshing style. Despite the relatively low sugar concentration and high acid levels, the flavours of the grapes must still be sufficiently ripe so that they no longer have any green herbaceous flavour characteristics.</p>

            <p>Meeting these requirements can be difficult in all but the coolest regions. In cool regions the changes to the sugar and acid levels happen slowly and at the same time as the changes to the grapes' flavours. However, in warm regions sugar levels can rise and acid levels fall very quickly. Picking early to get the correct levels of sugar and acid is the only option. However, this often means picking grapes that are still overly green and herbaceous. Ultimately, finding an area with a sufficiently cool climate is fundamental to growing grapes for premium sparkling wine production.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Handling The Grapes And Juice</h2>
            <p>To produce high-quality sparkling wines it is vital that the grapes and their juice are treated with care. Harvest The grapes for the best sparkling wines are typically hand-picked to retain whole bunches of unsplit grapes. However, in warm regions where grapes are being grown for the production of inexpensive sparkling wines, machine harvesting may be the most efficient way of picking all the grapes before they accumulate too much sugar and lose their acidity. Pressing avoiding crushing, contact between the skins and juice is minimised. In most EU regions legislation determines the maximum pressure that can be used during pressing and the amount of juice that can be extracted from the grapes.</p>

            <p>On arrival at the winery the grapes should be pressed as soon as possible. Pressing will be gentle, to minimise the extraction of any tannins and colour. This is especially important when using black grapes for white sparkling wines. The use of whole bunches helps with this. By METHODS OF MAKING SPARKLING WINE The winemaker will use one of six methods to produce a sparkling wine. In European wine regions the choice of method may be determined by local laws; outside Europe, it will be informed by the style or quality of wine that the winemaker wants to make, or the costs involved. Traditional Method</p>

            <p>This term indicates a wine that has undergone a second fermentation in the bottle in which it is later sold. It is the technique most often used to make premium sparkling wines and although it is costly and time-consuming, the wines it makes are also those that can often command the highest prices. After harvesting and pressing, the principal steps of the traditional method are: Making the base wine - The first alcoholic fermentation usually takes place in large temperature controlled stainless steel vats but some producers still use oak vats or barrels for some or all of their wines.

            <h2>Understanding Wines: Explaining Style And Quality</h2>
            <p>base wine is complemly dry with neutral flavours and high acidity The winemaker will decide, based on the style of wine to be made, whether the wine will undergo malolactic conversion and/or a period of maturation in oak before the second alcoholic fermentation. Most base wines are used the year after the harvest. However, some wines are stored for use in future years. These reserve wines have an important role to play in the blending process. Blending - The blending process is very important in the making of sparkling wines and serves a number of functions. First, many producers aim to make their sparkling wines in a particular house style, particularly for non-vintage products. Blending wines from different vineyards, grape varieties and/or vintages can help to achieve this house style year-on-year despite vintage variation</p>

            <p>Second, blending can be used to improve the balance of the wine. For example, Chardonnay is widely considered to bring citrus fruit, finesse and longevity to a blend, whereas Pinot Noir brings more body. Third, blending can enhance the complexity of the wine. Old reserve wines can bring flavours of dried fruit to the fresh flavours of the young wine. Likewise, some producers may choose to blend in wines that have been matured in oak to bring a broader texture and spicy flavours to the wine. It is easier to achieve these aims if blenders have as many wines as possible at their disposal. For this reason grapes are often fermented in many different small parcels, giving multiple blending options.</p>

            <p>Second alcoholic fermentation - Once the blend is made up, a small proportion of liqueur de tirage is added. This is a mixture of wine, sugar, yeast, yeast nutrients and a clarifying agent. The bottle is closed with a crown cap that includes a plastic cup insert. The bottles are then stacked horizontally in the producer's cellars at a cool, constant temperature. A slow fermentation takes place. The alcohol is raised by around 1.2-1.3% abv and the CO, generated by the yeast dissolves into the wine creating the sparkle. This creates pressure in the bottle equivalent to five to six atmospheres. Yeast autolysis - Once this second alcoholic fermentation is complete the yeast die and form a sediment of lees in the bottle. Over a period of months these dead yeast cells start to break down releasing chemical compounds into the wine, a process known as yeast autolysis. These compounds contribute to the flavour of the wine, typically giving bread, biscuit and toasty notes. Autolysis is usually most active over the first four to five years, but has been known to continue for several more years. Wines that spend longer on their lees normally develop a more pronounced yeast character. Once autolysis is complete, keeping the lees in contact with the wine can maintain the wine's freshness for years, however, in most cases, maturation</p>

            <p>will not last that long, with the yeast removed before autolysis is complete. Riddling - After the period of maturation, the lees sediment is removed using the two processes of riddling and disgorgement. Riddling involves moving the bottle very slowly from a horizontal to an inverted vertical position. The yeast sediment is dislodged and gradually slides down the side of the bottle collecting in the plastic cup insert in the crown cap. Traditionally, this was done by hand. The bottles were placed horizontally in the holes of an A-frame rack called a pupitre and then each day they were given a gentle shake and a twist and raised slightly closer to vertical. This was a very labour intensive process and took up to eight weeks to complete.</p>

            <p>Nowadays riddling is usually mechanised so that the work can be carried out faster and in bulk. The standard machine in use today is a gyropalette, a cage holding 500 bottles on a hydraulic arm, which is regularly rotated and inclined. This simulates hand riddling but completes the job in a matter of days. Disgorgement and corking - Once riddling is complete the neck of the upturned bottle is submerged in a very cold solution, which freezes the wine in the neck. The bottles are then inverted into a normal upright position keeping the wine clear. The crown cap seal is removed and the frozen wine holds the sediment in place, and the pressure created by the dissolved CO, ejects the frozen wine taking the sediment and plastic insert with it. The wine is topped up with liqueur d'expédition and sealed with a cork that is held secure by a wire cage. This whole process is now fully mechanised and the time taken from opening to resealing the bottle is a matter of seconds. This avoids a loss of pressure and reduces the risk of oxidation,</p>

            <p>Liqueur d'expédition is a mixture of wine and sugar. The amount of sugar used will determine the final level of sweetness in the wine and is often known as the dosage. It is used to balance the acidity and it helps with flavour development. There are some wines that are made without the addition of sugar at this stage. These wines are typically labelled Brut nature or Zéro dosage depending on the producer and wine region (for additional terms see Styles of Sparkling Wine later in this chapter). A small proportion of wine will still be added to top up the sparkling wine to the right level in the bottle.</p>

            <p>The characteristics of the wine within the liqueur d'expédition are very important. For example, the wine may be young and fresh, toasty from maturation in oak, or display dried fruit flavours from years in bottle. In effect this is a second blending operation used to create the house style. The vast majority of sparkling wines (made by any method) are sealed with a cork. In its original shape, a sparkling wine cork is a cylinder with an area on its round face about three times that of the opening of the bottle. 3 2 The familiar mushroom shape comes about after corking. In order to maintain a perfect seal the cork has to be compressed considerably before it can be inserted into the neck of the bottle. Even with this degree of compression, a wire cage is added for complete security.</p>

            <p>Bottle ageing-Once it has been corked the wine may then be aged for a further few months to allow the fiqueur d'expédition to integrate with the wine. Most sparkling wines are considered to be ready to drink when released; however, some premium wines can benefit from further ageing. Knowing the precise age of a sparkling wine can be problematic for retailers and consumers. This is because most sparkling wines are not vintage-dated and</p>

The yeast sediment is dearly visible. therefore it can be impossible to know whether the wine inside the bottle is youthful and fresh or more mature. A number of producers have now decided to include disgorgement dates on their labels to provide greater clarity for everyone. Transfer Method The transfer method is an adaptation of the traditional method that avoids the costly and complex process of riddling and disgorgement. The processes used in the transfer method are the same as those used in the traditional method up to the point of riddling but at this stage the entire contents of the bottles are simply disgorged into a sealed tank under pressure. The wine in the tank is filtered to remove the yeast lees, liqueur</p>

This can give good quality sparkling wines a cheaper price than the traditional method, and with large batches it is an easy way to ensure consistent quality and style. kis often possible to tell whether a wine has been made using the traditional or transfer method by looking at the labels. Transfer method wines will often state bottle-fermented' whereas the prestige that is associated with the traditional method means that many winemakers using this technique will print the term 'traditional method or méthode traditionnelle on their labels.</p>

            <p>Ancestral Method This is a very old method of producing sparkling wines that has recently increased in popularity. Unlike traditional and transfer method, it involves a single fermentation. The fermenting juice is bottled part way through (the single) fermentation, capturing the carbon dioxide in the bottle from this point. The wines may or may not be disgorged; the latter option can cause them to be cloudy and have some sediment. They are typically released for sale while young. Wines made by the ancestral method are often termed Pétillant naturel or Pet Nat They are typical of some areas in France, but are now made around the world from various grape varieties. They are typically dry to off-dry (depending on whether the fermentation has completed to dryness in the bottle), have low to medium alcohol levels and vary in pressure (how sparkling they are).</p>

            <p>Tank Method Whereas both the traditional method and the transfer method can produce wines that have flavours of bread and toast, the tank method allows the production of sparkling wine that retains the flavours of the base wine in large volumes at a lower price. This method is ideal for making sparkling wines out of grape varieties with strong flavours such as Muscat and Riesling, as well as for making fruity styles of sparkling wines such as Prosecco. It is cheaper, faster and less labour intensive than bottle fermenting and therefore is a popular method for the production of sparkling wines. It has often been</p>

            <h2>Sparkling Wine Production</h2>
            <p>considered as an inferior method to the traditional method but with high-quality grapes and care during production, high-quality sparkling wines can be made in this way. The first fermentation takes place in temperature controlled stainless steel tanks to retain the pure fruit and floral flavours of the grapes. The resulting base wines do not usually undergo malolactic conversion or oak ageing. Yeast, sugar, yeast nutrients and clarifying agents are added to the wine and second fermentation takes place in a sealed tank able to withstand the pressure as the CO2 dissolves in the wine. The wine is filtered to remove the yeast lees before it is bottled under pressure. The majority of tank method wines show no notes of yeast autolysis because they do not spend extended time on the lees. Autolytic character can be created by using paddles to stir up the lees during second fermentation. However, most winemakers using the tank method will want to retain primary fruit flavours.</p>

            <p>Asti Method This method is principally used for the production of sweet sparkling wines in the Asti region of Piemonte, Italy. It produces sweet fruity sparkling wines, but is somewhat unusual in that there is only one alcoholic fermentation involved. The juice is chilled and stored until needed. When it is required, the juice is warmed and the fermentation takes place in pressurised tanks. Initially the CO, is allowed to escape. Part way through fermentation the tank is sealed so that CO2 is retained. The ferment continues until the alcohol has reached approximately 7% abv and the pressure four to five atmospheres. The fermentation is stopped early by chilling the wine, which is then filtered under pressure to remove the yeast. The wine is bottled for immediate sale.</p>

            <p>Carbonation In this method CO, is injected into a still wine, which is then bottled under pressure. It is useful for producing fruity sparkling wines that retain the flavours of the base wine. For this reason it is often used to make sparkling wines from grapes with strong varietal flavours, for</p>

            <h2>Styles Of Sparkling Wine</h2>
            <p>Sparkling wines are made in a range of sweetness levels. Those made within the EU or made for sale within the EU must use certain labelling terms to denote the level of sweetness (see table EU Labelling Terms for Sweetness in Sparkling Wines). It is important to note that there is a range of sweetness levels allowed for each description. Some producers will use the lower end of the range and some the higher end. This contributes to different producers' house styles. Many of these sweetness labelling terms are widely copied around the globe but only need to comply with these regulations if the wine is being sold in the EU,</p>

            <p>The following terms are used to describe styles of sparkling wines: Non-vintage-This is not a labelling term, but it is used to describe wines made from grapes harvested in more than one vintage. These wines tend to represent the standard offering from the producer and display the house style. Vintage-In Champagne, this term means that the wine must come from a single year. However, some appellations In other regions may allow a small percentage of grapes from other years to be included in the blend. In regions that experience considerable vintage variation, such as Champagne, vintage wines will only be made in the very</p>

            <p>best years, and thus command a price premium. In other regions, vintage wines may be made more frequently, and may not be held in quite the same esteem. Rosé - Rosé sparkling wines can either be made by blending red and white base wines or by a short maceration. Colour can also be adjusted with the liqueur d'expédition. There are some sparkling wine appellations that only permit their rosé wines to be made by maceration. Blanc de Blancs - A white sparkling wine made only from white grape varieties. Blanc de Noirs - A white sparkling wine made only from black grape varieties. Prestige Cuvée - This is also not a labelling term but generally describes the best wine(s) in a producer's range. Although small in number, these wines are an important part of the sparkling wine market. This is particularly true of Champagne, where reputations have been built based on an association with luxury as well as celebration.</p>

Such is its reputation that most premium sparkling wines are not only made in the same way but also using the same grape varieties. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that Champagne is not to everyone's taste and less acidic and sweeter sparkling wines are hugely popular. The regulations that relate to sparkling wine in the EU are varied and complex. In this chapter we will focus primarily on those relating to permitted grape varieties and lees ageing. Outside of the EU winemakers are free from such restraints even though they widely copy techniques that are practised within Europe.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Champagne</h2>
            <p>Champagne consists of a single appellation. Certain villages within the region have a cru status; 44 are rated premier cru and 17 grand cru, but these are not separate appellations. Unlike in Burgundy or Alsace, it is the whole village that is rated and not specific vineyard sites, and the growers in these villages are not required to meet stricter production requirements such as lower yields Inevitably, there will be some outstanding sites within villages that have lower ratings. Equally, not every plot within a village rated grand cru will have the same potential. Nevertheless, this classification persists and these terms are permitted on Champagne labels.</p>

            <p>Within the appellation boundaries there are five sub-regions where there are major concentrations of vineyards. These are spread over a considerable area. The three most famous sub-regions, which are close to the major production centres of Reims and Épernay, are Montagne de Reims, Vallée de la Marne and the Côte des Blancs. The Côte de Sézanne lies approximately 30 kilometres south-west of Épernay and the Côte des Bar is over 100 kilometres to the south-east. Climate and Grape Growing Champagne has a cool continental climate. Viticulture is challenging and growers regularly have to contend with winter freeze, spring frosts and rainy, cloudy weather. However, even in the warmest years grape sugar levels remain low and acid levels high, which makes this region ideal for sparkling wine production.</p>

            <p>Frost is one of the biggest challenges in the vineyard. In order to minimise this threat most vineyards are planted on slopes. The soils in Champagne are dominated by chalk, which provides good drainage after rain storms but retains a sufficient quantity of water in dry periods. Champagne's producers are now fully committed to sustainable agriculture and have ambitious targets to reduce their use of man-made fertilisers and pesticides.</p>

It gives much lighter-bodied wines than in Burgundy and has high acidity with a floral and citrus fruit character. Pinot Noir dominates in Montagne de Reims and Côte des Bar. This variety produces wines of greater body and provides the structural backbone to most blends. Meunier predominates in the Vallée de la</p>

            <h2>Sparkling Wines Of The World</h2>
            <p>181 The hilly landscape of Conegliano-Valdobbiadene DOCG is heavily planted with Glera grapes for the production of Prosecco. Marne because it buds late, protecting it from the spring frosts that occur more frequently in this area. This black grape variety gives fruity flavours to a blend, and is especially important for wines that are made to be enjoyed while young. Winemaking Champagne is made using the traditional method. Grapes must be hand-picked to allow selection in the vineyard and retain whole, healthy bunches. The pressing process is also highly controlled. The first liquid to come off the press is called the cuvée, which contains the purest juice, and the remainder is called the taille. The best Champagnes will be made solely from the cuvée.</p>

            <p>Primary fermentation can be carried out in stainless steel vats, oak barrels or a mixture of the two, malolactic conversion can be encouraged or prevented and the base wines aged briefly in oak or stored in inert vessels only. This all depends on house style. The weather in Champagne can vary significantly from year to year and therefore blending is incredibly important. Wines may be fermented in small parcels to allow a greater number of blending options. Large Champagne producers will use dozens of wines in their blends to achieve their house style year on year. The length of time that the wine is aged, including its time on lees, is dependent on the style of wine being made. Non-vintage wines must be aged for a minimum of 15 months, including at least 12 months on the lees. Vintage wines must be matured for a minimum of 36 months (including at least 12 months on the lees). In practice, however, the winemakers frequently mature their wines for considerably longer.</p>

            <p>Champagne comes in a range of quality levels and styles, but the wines all have high acidity and some autolytic flavours. Non-vintage wines are generally lighter in body, with more fresh fruit flavours than vintage wines. The finest examples display some complexity from the use of reserve wines. Vintage wines are made in the best years. They are often more concentrated than non-vintage wines, and display more age these wines on the lees for longer than their non- toasty and biscuity notes as many winemakers choose to vintage wines. Rosé Champagne can be made in both non-vintage and vintage styles. The best wines delicately balance aromas from autolysis with subtle fruity red berry notes. Blanc de Blancs wines are typically light to medium-bodied with citrus primary fruit; they can be more austere in youth but can age in bottle for a long time. Blanc de Noirs styles tend to be fulier in body but can age more quickly</p>

            <p>Many Champagne houses now make a Prestige Cuvée that represents the finest wine in their range. They are often, but not always, vintage wines and are made from the best parcels of grapes. Many of these wines can be closed and austere in their youth and therefore can repay several years cellaring before drinking. They command premium prices. Champagne is made in a range of sweetness levels, but Brut is by far the most popular style. A trend has been the rise of Brut nature wines, but they still represent a very small proportion of the market.</p>

            <h2>Crémant</h2>
            <p>The term crémant applies to a number of Fr sparkling wine ACs, of which the most imp Crémant d'Alsace. Crémant de Bourgogne and Crémant de Loire. The wines are made by the traditional method and must spend a minimum of nine months on the lees. Generally speaking, each of these wines will be made from the grapes used for making the still white wines of the region, although aromatic grape varieties such as Muscat and Gewurztraminer are not permitted for crémant wines in Alsace, while Chardonnay is allowed.</p>

            <h2>Saumur And Vouvray</h2>
            <p>Catalan vineyards centred on the town of Sant Sadurní d'Anoia. Other notable areas where there are vineyards permitted to make Cava include Navarra, Rioja and Valencia. The wines are made by the traditional method and must spend at least nine months on the lees. Traditional grape varieties include Macabeo (Viura). Xarel-lo and Parellada for the white wines and Garnacha and Monastrell for the rosés. Most Cava that is made from the traditional varieties is dry with medium acidity and some character from yeast autolysis, although these flavours can differ in nature from the bread and toast character found in Champagne. Chardonnay and Pinot Noir were more recently added to the permitted grape varieties of the appellation and some producers have found that these varieties can add an extra level of both fruit and acidity to the wines. The use of these two varieties has caused controversy in the region as some producers believe it detracts from Cava's point of difference.</p>

            <p>After Champagne, the Loire Valley is the next biggest centre of sparkling wine production in France. There are two other major appellations for sparkling wine as well as Crémant de Loire Sparkling Saumur can be made from a range of local varieties as well as Chardonnay which, with Chenin Blanc and Cabernet Franc, is an important ingredient in the best wines. Sparkling rosé wines are also made, using Cabernet Franc Sparkling Vouvray is made in greater volume than still Vouvray, and the vast majority is made solely from Chenin Blanc. Chenin Blanc has a naturally high acidity that is well suited to sparkling wine production. It does not take on as much of a bready, biscuity character as Chardonnay or Pinot Noir, and the autolytic character, when present, tends to be more smoky and toasty. Sparkling Saumur and Vouvray are both made using the traditional method and must spend a minimum of nine months on the lees.</p>

However, the vast majority of Cava comes from the Most Cava is non-vintage and is ready to drink on release from the winery. The wines are generally lower in acidity than most Champagne, giving them an approachable, easy-drinking style. There are a few producers making premium Cavas that have undergone extensive lees ageing.</p>

            <h2>Asti</h2>
            <p>The Asti DOCG is located in Piemonte in north-west Italy. It is made from Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains using the Asti Method and has the distinct grapey character associated with this variety. The best examples have a pronounced, fruity aroma of peach and grape overlaid with floral notes. All Asti is sweet, low in alcohol 182 Tasmania's coal climate provides perfect conditions for growing grapes for sparkling wines.</p>

            <h2>Prosecco</h2>
            <p>Prosecco is made in north-east Italy. The two principal regions are Prosecco DOC, which covers a wide area of the Veneto and Friuli, and the higher quality Conegliano-Valdobbiadene DOCG. Fruit for the latter must be grown between the two towns of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene on the steep limestone hills north- west of Venice. The terms Cartizze and Rive both indicate a wine from an exceptional vineyard site. The principal variety of the DOC and DOCG is Glera. This grape variety was previously known as Prosecco, but this was changed so that Prosecco could be used to designate defined areas that were entitled to use the name and to prevent other regions or countries from exploiting the success of</p>

            <p>the name. Prosecco is typically produced by the tank method and the wines have medium acidity with fresh aromas of green apple and melon. It is made in Brut, Extra-Dry and Dry styles but typically these wines have slightly higher levels of residual sugar than would be found in most Champagne and Cava. In Prosecco any residual sugar is usually a result of interrupting fermentation by chilling and filtering. These wines are meant to be consumed when they are young and fresh and do not benefit from bottle ageing. A change in legislation in 2020 means that sparkling rosé can now be produced by the DOC. The wines are predominantly made from Glera blended with a small proportion (up to 15% ) of Pinot Noir.</p>

            <h2>Sekt</h2>
            <p>Germany is an enormous market for sparkling wine and has the highest per capita consumption of sparkling wine in the world. Most of this is Sekt, virtually all of which is made using the tank method. The base wines generally come from France, Italy or Spain, but are turned into sparkling wines within Germany. On the other hand, wines labelled as Deutscher Sekt, in addition to being made sparkling in Germany, must also only use grapes grown in Germany. The best are made from Riesling If all the grapes for the wine come from one of the quality wine regions, for example Mosel, then the wine can bear the superior appellation of Deutscher Sekt bA. Some of the top estates will produce such wines from individual vineyards, using the traditional method, although these premium Sekts are made in much smaller quantities</p>

            <h2>Australia</h2>
            <p>Australian sparkling wines are made in a wide variety of styles. Cool and moderate regions such as Yarra Valley. Adelaide Hills and Tasmania, are capable of producing complex, elegant traditional method wines, usually from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. These wines are made in a multitude of styles including non-vintage, vintage, rosé Blanc de Blancs and Blanc de Noirs. Inexpensive sparkling wines are typically produced in warm regions such as Riverina. Generally produced by tank method or carbonation, they are fruity in style and come in a range of sweetness levels. Many different grape varieties may be used.</p>

            <p>Although sparkling red wines are not unique to Australia, this is one of the countries where they have had most commercial success. However, there has been a significant decline in the sales of these wines over recent years. The best sparkling reds are typically made from Shiraz but some wineries have produced excellent examples from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. As with the white sparkling wines, inexpensive wines are made by carbonation or tank method, and better examples are produced by transfer or the traditional method. Generally the wines are full-bodied, with red berry fruit, smooth tannins and some residual sugar.</p>

            <h2>New Zealand</h2>
            <p>New Zealand has an established reputation for high- quality traditional method sparkling wines made from the classic Champagne grape varieties. Its relatively southerly position in the Southern Hemisphere and maritime climate with cool sea breezes means that it can ripen Chardonnay and Pinot Noir slowly enough to produce elegant sparkling wines. A range of styles is made including non-vintage, vintage, rosé, Blanc de Blancs and Blanc de Noirs. Grapes for sparkling wine production are grown in all the wine regions, however, Marlborough produces the highest volumes. The warmer regions in North Island produce a richer style compared with the wines from the South Island and producers often take advantage of this fact making cross regional blends.</p>

            <p>Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc is also produced, usually by carbonation or the tank method to retain the intense aromas and flavours of this grape variety.</p>

Site selection is very important in South Africa's warm climate and the best sites are found on hillside slopes with a south- eastern aspect, or near the coast. Cap Classique wines must spend a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Many premium producers belong to the Cap Classique Producers Association, whose focus is to continually promote and enhance the quality of Cap Classique wines There is also a large domestic market for sparkling off-dry to sweet carbonated sparkling wines. USA California is responsible for the vast majority of sparkling wine production in the USA. The best wines come from cooler locations, such as Los Carneros AVA and Anderson Valley AVA. Premium wines are made using the traditional method, generally using Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. These wines typically spend extended ageing on the lees. Many of the best wines display concentrated complex flavours balanced by high acidity. Large volumes of inexpensive wines are made by the tank method or carbonation. These wines are typically fruity and often medium-sweet to sweet in style. They are made from a range of grape varieties, grown in warmer, high-yielding regions such as Central Valley</p>
