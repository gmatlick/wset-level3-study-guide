        <h1>Australia</h1>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>Australia Australia has been incredibly successful at taking International grape varieties and crafting them into unique and new styles. Among the most famous are full-bodied Shirazs, Time flavoured Rieslings, elegant Cabernets and subtle Semillons that evolve for decades. This diversity is set to grow as new regions, grape varieties and wine styles continue to be explored.</p>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Climate And Grape Growing</h2>
            <p>Australia's land mass is similar in size to that of the United States and larger than that of Europe; it is therefore no restrained styles by controlling the level of extraction in the winemaking process. A leaner, more peppery style is generally made in cooler regions such as Geelong and surprise that a diverse range of climates can be found here. Heathcote. These qualities may be combined in a mult regional blended wine. Shiraz is also used to give regions have warm or hot climates. Many of these regions softness and body to blends with Cabernet Sauvignon are tempered by their proximity to either the Southern or performing a similar role to Merlot in Bordeaux.</p>

            <p>Indian Ocean or the Murray River system. Others, such as Adelaide Hills and Eden Valley, are cooled by altitude. In many regions rainfall is low and irrigation in the growing season is essential. Drought can be a significant problemn and in extreme years even the Murray River, which provides a vital source of water for the inland vineyard areas of Riverland and Murray-Darling, can run low. The dry conditions combined with high summer temperatures mean bush fires are a very real risk in certain areas. Even if the vineyard is not damaged or destroyed, the smoke from such fires can come into contact with the grapes causing a pungent taint in the wines. Many producers are seeking sites with cool or moderate climates and plantings have increased in Jugh-altitude locations on the mainland and in Tasmania, which has a more southerly latitude.</p>

            <h2>Grape Varieties And Winemaking</h2>
            <p>Black Varieties Australia's principal grape variety of either colour is Shiraz, and it is grown widely in most regions. Hot regions such as Hunter Valley and warm regions such as Barossa Valley can produce full-bodied, intensely fruity Shiraz. These wines also often display earthy or spicy notes and develop leather aromas as they age. In these areas, a number of winemakers are now making more</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Australian Wine Laws</h2>
            <p>Australian Cabernet Sauvignon is generally darker, with firmer tannins and higher acidity than Shiraz displaying ripe black fruit characters (blackcurrant, black cherry), often underpinned by toasty oak notes. Classic regions include Coonawarra and Margaret River. In Australia, Merlot tends to be found in blended wines typically alongside Cabernet Sauvignon, to provide body and fleshy, plummy fruit. Pinot Noir is grown in a number of Australian regions and the best examples tend to come from cool or moderate sites in regions such as Yarra Valley. Mornington Peninsula and Tasmania. In general, the style of Pinot Noir from these regions tends to be medium-bodied with medium alcohol, medium to high acidity and typical flavours of cherry and strawberry.</p>

            <p>Australia's hot regions are perfect for late ripening varieties such as Grenache, Petit Verdot and Mataro (Mourvèdre). Varieties from Italy and Spain such as Sangiovese and Tempranillo have also gained in popularity in recent years because they are well adapted to high summer temperatures and a limited water supply White Varieties Chardonnay is the most planted white wine grape in Australia. It is planted widely throughout the vineyard regions, and is made in a wide range of styles. Basic in Australia, there is a hierarchy of Gls incorporating zones, regions and sub-regions. Zones are large areas without any particular qualifying attributes. They can either be states (such as South Australia) or cover several states (such as South Eastern Australia) Zones can also make up part of a state, but with the possible exception of Barossa these zones are rarely</p>

            <p>seen on labels Regions such as Coonawarra, Clare Valley and Margaret River) can vary in size and are smaller than zones. They must have consistent and distinct qualities from neighbouring regions, Many regions are split into sub-regions, if there are notable areas that have distinct and unique qualities. Although a sub-region must fall within one region, some regions are covered by several zones. For example, Eden Valley is a region within the Barossa zone, which is within the zone of South Australia, which, in turn, is within South Eastern Australia zone. This gives producers a variety of options when it comes to making up their blends.</p>

            <p>Chardonnay is often a blend of fruit from gions produced unoaked to give peachy bours or with the aid of oak chips or staves to add w of toast and vanilla, At the other end of the w high-quality Chardonnays from cool to Ate regions such as Adelaide Hills, Mornington Rule and Yarra Valley and even warm regions such Margaret River are often beautifully balanced with fe vibrant fruit complemented by subtle flavours careful use of lees, malolactic conversion and/or maturation, The popularity of Sauvignon Blanc in both the domestic and export markets means it is now widely planted. The moderate climate area of Adelaide Hills has eloped a reputation as the benchmark for the variety. The wines tend to show concentrated passion fruit favours alongside refreshing high acidity.</p>

            <p>Semillon is used to make distinctive wines in a style that is unique to Australia. It is planted widely, but the dassic region is Hunter Valley. Here, it is harvested early, with low sugar levels and a high acidity. In the winery, contact with oxygen is kept to a minimum and inert vessels are used for fermentation and storage. The resultant wines are light in alcohol and almost neutral flavour when first bottled, yet they develop extraordinary flavours of honey and toast with bottle age. The best of these wines can age for 20 years or more. In Western Australia a much more herbaceous sole is made, which could be mistaken for Sauvignon Blanc Barossa Valley traditionally made Semillon in a fuller bodied, softer style; however, early-picked, unaked versions are now increasingly being produced.</p>

            <p>Riesling is also made in a style that is unique to Australia. The wines typically have pronounced citrus fuit aromas and flavours (lime, lemon, grapefruit) in youth that develop rapidly into toast, honey and petrol notes as the wines age. The wines are unoaked with high levels of acidity, and are usually dry or slightly off-dry, athough some sweet wines are also made. Classic regions include the Eden and Clare Valleys in South Australia. Tasmania, and the Great Southern region of Western Australia, have also developed reputations for high quality Rieslings. Here the wines are less citrusy and more floral.</p>

            <p>Barossa Valley To the north of Adelaide, the Barossa Valley region is the heartland of fine wine production. In the warm, dry climate, old bush vines produce outstanding Shiraz, which lies to the north-west of the Barossa Valley, Here, the warm climate is tempered by cool afternoon breezes and nights are cold. Many vineyards are planted at altitude (300 to 400 metres), some even as high as 570 Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache Classic Barossa Valley metres. Clare Valley Rieslings are dry in style with intense Shiraz is full-bodied, with soft tannins and ripe black fruit citrus and lime aromas and a high acidity. With bottle complemented by American oak. It softens and develops age they can develop honey and toast characters. Clare</p>

            <p>aromas of leather and spice as it ages. The most notable white vanety is Semillion, which is increasingly made in a fresh, unoaked style. Wines labelled Barossa come from the Barossa zone and can be made from fruit sourced from Barossa Valley and Eden Valley. Eden Valley Located in the hills to the east of the Barossa Valley, the Eden Valley region has a cool to moderate climate that varies with altitude. Outstanding quality Rieslings are made in the cooler vineyards, having intense lime and grapefruit aromas and a steely character. The best have longevity displaying marmalade and toasty characters after ten years. Shiraz. Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are also grown with success.</p>

            <p>Clare Valley Riesling is also the speciality of the Clare Valley region, Valley Shiraz is fragrant, powerful and structured. Excellent quality Cabernet Sauvignon is also produced with varying styles depending on the vineyard location, soil and elevation. The best red wines have a long cellaring potential. Adelaide Hills Twenty-five kilometres east of Adelaide, the Adelaide Hills region has a moderate climate where all vineyards are planted above 400 metres in altitude Rainfall occurs mainly in the winter, and soils have limited water-holding capacity meaning that irrigation is often necessary during the growing season. The region specialises in making refreshing Sauvignon Blancs as well as elegant Chardonnays that have high natural acidities and pronounced citrus and peach aromas. Pinot Noir is also grown for still red wines and blending with Chardonnay for sparkling wine.</p>

Range Sydney Tasman Sea McLaren Vale The McLaren Vale region is located on the coast to the south of Adelaide. Here, afternoon breezes from the nearby ocean temper the warm climate. The region largely produces red wine from Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Grenache. The wines are intensely flavoured with dark fruit aromas and have soft, ripe tannins. Some old vine Shiraz and Grenache are used to create wines with depth and complexity. Coonawarra The Coonawarra region is a narrow strip of land 1.5 kilometres wide by 15 kilometres long, with a distinctive red terra rossa soil over a limestone subsoil. It lies 400 kilometres south-east of Adelaide, towards the Victorian border. Under the influence of cold currents from the Antarctic, the maritime climate is moderate. Cloud cover moderates summer temperatures.</p>

            <p>Cabernet Sauvignon, which predominates, is made into concentrated, structured wines with characteristic cassis and eucalyptus or menthol aromas. The best examples age very well. Shiraz, Merlot and Chardonnay are also widely planted.</p>

            <h2>Victoria</h2>
            <p>Victoria offers some of the coolest vineyard locations on the Australian mainland. The wine regions around Melbourne and Port Phillip Bay benefit from ocean breezes, giving conditions cool enough to grow high- quality Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and grapes for sparkling wine. Further inland, the Great Dividing Range provides a range of altitudes and aspects. High altitude sites such as those in the regions of Macedon Ranges and Upper Goulburn make elegant Pinot Noir and Chardonnay as well as aromatic Riesling and Sauvignon Blanc. Regions on lower slopes grow later-ripening black varieties such as Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon; these wines are often fresher and lighter in style than those from Australia's hotter regions.</p>

            <p>Yarra Valley The Yarra Valley region is located to the north-east of Melbourne. Broadly speaking the climate is cool to moderate and maritime, but this is a very varied region with a wide range of altitude and aspects. Pinot Noir is the speciality.

            <p>N wines, the region is renowned for its excellent quality sparkling wines. Yarra Valley Pinot Noir is generally rich in fruit, with strawberries, plums and dark cherries. The tannins are ripe and soft and careful oak handling adds complexity. The top producers make age-worthy wines. The geographical diversity here means that Chardonnay, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon are also successfully made in a range of styles although never with quite the body of similar wines from warmer regions Mornington Peninsula Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are also specialities of the Mornington Peninsula region, located to the south of Melbourne. This coastal wine region has a cool to moderate, maritime climate and is home to small boutique estates. Vintages can vary here due to the chance of cool, wet and windy weather at flowering and often at harvest. The best years have a long growing season producing fragrant, elegant wines with finesse. Mornington Peninsula Pinot Noir ranges from light and delicate, to more structured, but all tend to display very pure fruit characteristics. Chardonnays reflect the cool growing conditions having citrus, pear and apple aromas and high acidities that are usually softened by malolactic conversion.</p>

            <p>Geelong The Geelong region lies west of Melbourne and has similar climatic conditions to the Mornington Peninsula. Geelong Chardonnay is renowned for its quality and tends to be complex, concentrated and full bodied, Pinot Noir and Shiraz are the major red grapes planted. Pinot Noir can take on earthy aromas, and Shiraz is generally fresh and peppery. Both Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are also used for sparkling wines. Heathcote Heathcote is located in the centre of Victoria, much further inland than the Yarra Valley, Mornington Peninsula and Geelong. Cooling influences here come from altitude rather than the ocean giving a moderate climate, and helping to produce Shiraz wines that have a firmer structure and fresher fruit flavours than those of warmer regions. Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are also widely planted and Mediterranean grapes such as Sangiovese and Tempranillo have shown promise.</p>

            <h2>New South Wales</h2>
            <p>New South Wales has the longest history of wine production in Australia. The main region here is the hot Hunter Valley; however, the regions of Mudgee. Orange and Cowra offer wine producers slightly cooler conditions.
