3. **Use Technical Language**: Demonstrate knowledge of proper viticulture and winemaking terminology
4. **Practice Writing**: Time yourself on 25-mark questions (30 minutes each)
5. **Taste Systematically**: Use the WSET SAT for every wine to build muscle memory
6. **Connect Concepts**: Understand how climate → viticulture → winemaking → style
