        <h1>Germany Wine Regions</h1>

            <p>Black Grape Varieties Spätburgunder (Pinot Noir) is the third most planted grape variety in Germany It thrives in the warmer vineyard areas and is particularly important in Pfalz and Baden. Wines are dry and either relatively light and fruity or made in a more concentrated style that often includes oak aromas. Dornfelder is the other black variety that is widely planted. It produces particularly deeply coloured wines Other varieties include Portugieser Trollinger and Schwarzriesling (Meunier). These varieties typically produce light-bodied and fruity wines although intensely coloured and flavoured examples with some oak character exist. The vast majority of these wines are sold as Qualitätsweine and consumed by the domestic market. WINE REGIONS Mosel This region includes the River Mosel, from where it joins the River Rhine (Rhein) to the German border and its two small tributaries, the Saar and the Ruwer White grapes and Riesling in particular dominate production Riesling is the only permitted variety for GG wines.</p>

            <p>Production is concentrated in the centre of the region in an area known as the Middle Mosel where there are a number of villages that have an established reputation for top-quality wine. The best known are Piesport Bernkastel and Wehlen. The best vineyards are found on very steep slopes with slate soils right next to the river. The Rieslings here are typically lighter in body. lower in alcohol and higher in acidity compared with the wines of Rheingau, Rheinhessen and Pfalz. Floral and green fruit flavours predominate. The cooler Saar and Ruwer account for only a tiny percentage of the overall plantings in the Mosel. The best wines are similar in both style and quality to the Middle Mosel often showing an even higher level of acidity. In cooler vintages grapes from even the best sites do not ripen fully and are used in sparkling wine production.</p>

            <p>Nahe The vineyards of the Nahe are spread over a wide area that lies in between the Mosel and Rheinhessen. The best vineyards are situated on the banks of the River Nahe itself in the short section between the villages of Schlossböckelheim and Bad Kreuznach. These vineyards are on steep south-facing slopes. The best wines are made from Riesling, which is the most widely planted variety here, and can be made in a style that lies in between that of the Mosel and the fuller bodied wines from Rheingau, Rheinhessen and Pfalz. This is the only permitted variety for GG wines. They have the pronounced acidity of the Mosel but they can have a slightly riper fruit character as the climate here is warmer. Rheingau The Rheingau is a small but prestigious region. Most vineyards are situated on the slopes of the north bank of the River Rhine (in the west of the region) and the River Main (in the east) and have a southerly aspect. This, combined with the protection offered by the Taunus hills to the north, provides optimal conditions for ripening</p>

            <p>grapes The majority of the vineyards lie on the slopes to the west of the region and surround the villages of Johannisberg and Rüdesheim Riesling dominates plantings and the majority of the wines are made in a dry style. The Rieslings have a medium to full body and a distinct ripe peach character to their fruit flavours. The humid conditions generated by the Rhine mean that some of Germany's best BA and TBA wines are made here too. The vineyards to the east of the region on the Main are centred around the village of Hochheim. The Rieslings can be riper and fuller bodied due to a slightly warmer climate. Some excellent Spätburgunder is also made here to the west of Rüdesheim in the village of Assmannshausen. GG wines can be made from Riesling or Spätburgunder, Rheinhessen This is the largest vine-growing region. A very broad range of black and white varieties are planted here. Müller-Thurgau and Riesling are the two most planted varieties of either colour. Black varieties, mostly Dornfelder, Portugieser and Spätburgunder, make up approximately 30 per cent of the plantings. GG wines here can be made from Riesling or Spätburgunder</p>

            <p>The reputation of Rheinhessen was based on the steeply sloping vineyards on the west bank of the Rhine centred around the village of Nierstein. This area, often referred to as the Rheinterrasse, produces some of the fullest-bodied Rieslings in Germany, In recent years a number of growers working in areas that do not have a long-standing reputation for wine production (for example the area in the south of the region near Worms) have started to produce top-quality wines. As a result, Rheinhessen has gained a reputation for innovation and excellence. LUX</p>

            <p>Pfalz is the second largest wine-growing region in Germany. The majority of the vineyards can be seen as a continuation of the vineyards of Alsace. They run in a narrow 80 kilometre strip north from the French border and lie to the east of the Haardt Mountains, which are a continuation of the Vosges. This means that the Pfalz is the driest of the German regions and in very warm years the vines can suffer from water stress. Riesling is the most widely planted variety and has the longest reputation for high-quality winemaking. Müller-Thurgau is also widely grown, while plantings of Grauburgunder and Weißburgunder are gradually increasing. Black grapes account for just under 40 per cent of the vineyard area Dornfelder is the second most widely planted variety of either colour and there are significant plantings of Portugieser (for the local market) and Spätburgunder (which is gaining an international reputation). GG wines can be made from Riesling, Weißburgunder or Spätburgunder.</p>

            <p>The most established quality vineyards surround Forst and Deidesheim, an area often referred to as Mittelhaardt. Set on the steep slopes to the west of the villages, the vineyards here produce a ripe, fuller-bodied style of Riesling. As has happened in Rheinhessen, young and energetic growers are making top-quality wines outside of this core region. The majority of wines are now made in the drier styles. Baden Baden is the warmest and most southerly wine region and produces the fullest-bodied German wines with the highest alcohols. Baden's vineyards are spread over a large geographic area although in terms of vineyard area it is only the third largest vine growing region in Germany. Most of the vineyards are spaced out over a narrow strip of land that follows the Rhine to the Swiss border. Nearly a third of the plantings are concentrated</p>
