            <p>Another important consideration is the amount of time the wine may need to be kept before release for sale. Some wines are matured for several months or even years, as required by local production regulations. Storage facilities can be expensive to maintain. Furthermore, a great deal of money is tied up in stock that cannot be sold to generate a profit straight away. Any delay in being able to take a profit from the wine needs to be factored into the sales price. 21 10 8 Incredibly steep vineyards, such as these in Mosel, are more expensive to cultivate than flat land, adding to a producer's casts.</p>

            <h2>Packaging</h2>
            <p>Bottles, labels, capsules, closures and cartons all need to be designed and purchased. Unusually shaped or heavy bottles cost more. It is cheaper to export wine in bulk and bottle it in the market where it is to be sold but this is only an option for large producers and it is not always permitted by local wine laws. TRANSPORT, DISTRIBUTION AND SALES For a very small number of producers the cost of getting a wine to market is negligible because they only sell their wine to people who visit their winery. However, the majority of producers seek to sell their wine further afield, often in both domestic and international markets.</p>

            <p>Transport, distribution and sales are a very complex part of the wine trade and are highly regulated. In the majority of cases, producers have to rely on other businesses to transport and distribute their wines, therefore it is important that they choose partners who offer both value for money and access to reliable sales.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, the price of a bottle of wine is determine how much the destination market is prepared to pay it. The costs of production, packaging, distribution retail must all be taken into account to ensure the product is commercially viable. Where high demand exists for a product that is available in limited supply, the retail price can far outweigh the costs. For example, over the last ten years, demand for premium estate wines from Bordeaux has put pressure on supply, driving up prices substantially. However, market forces may in time lead to a reversal of this trend.</p>

            <h2>Factors That Affect The Price Of Wine</h2>
            <p>While some wine businesses are profitable, there are others that struggle due to lack of demand. Some steep vineyard sites in Mosel have been abandoned because the costs of production could only be recovered by pricing the wines at a level consumers were not prepared to pay.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Types Of Wine Producer</h2>
            <p>There are three main types of wine producer: co-operatives, merchants and estates. None of these words has legal significance and they rarely appear on labels. Throughout the world it is quite common for a single producer to make different wines that are bottled under estate and merchant labels. Co-operatives These are wine businesses owned by their members, typically grape growers. The growers deliver their grapes to a winery that is owned by the co-operative and run by a winemaking team that is employed by the co-operative. This is good for the growers because they are guaranteed a buyer for their grapes but it can sometimes be challenging for the winemaker who might not always have complete control over the quality of the grapes supplied by their employers. However, this does not mean that co-operative wines are always inferior, and in some regions, the local co-operative regularly produces some of the best wines from the area.</p>

            <p>Co-operatives are very common in Europe. This is because the average vineyard holding for a grower in Europe is so small that it is rarely economical for them to produce and market their own wines. Co-operatives do exist in the rest of the world but they are less common. Merchants Merchants buy grapes, juice or wine from either growers or co- operatives. Merchants will have contracts with their suppliers and, in theory, have greater control over their source material than some co- operatives. Producers can reject grapes that are not up to standard but in regions where grapes are in high demand or limited supply it can be difficult to guarantee a regular supply of suitable grapes. These</p>

            <p>businesses can operate on a very small scale and focus on premium wine production, or operate on a large scale and produce a range of wines at different quality levels. Merchants are common throughout the world but especially outsi of Europe. In these regions grape growers have far larger holdings compared with European growers and this type of contractual arrangement is popular with producers who only have to deal with a relatively small number of growers. Many of the large wine brands are made this way. Merchants are sometimes referred to using the French name for this type of business: négociant.</p>

            <p>Estates These businesses make wine only from the grapes that they grow. As result, they typically produce wine on a relatively small scale. This ges the producer the greatest amount of control in the production process and consequently, in most regions, these producers are responsible f the best wines. However, because estates rely purely on their own op they can have fewer blending options and this can be a challenge in years where the growing conditions have been poor, for example due frost or hail. Estate wines are made throughout the winemaking world and are sometimes referred to using the French name for this type of busines domaine.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Wines</h2>
            <p>11 Wine and the Law In countries where it is legal to purchase and consume alcohol, legislation relating to wine is concerned with three important issue ensuring it is safe for human consumption; checking the information on the label accurately describes what is in the bottle; and, as alcohol is both toxic and addictive, providing the necessary regulations reduce the harm it can cause to individuals and societies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Food Safety</h2>
            <p>With regard to food and beverage legislation, the primary concern of the authorities will always be to ensure that what is being sold is safe and fit for human consumption. This is a complex and technical area of the law and concerns the many processing agents and chemicals that are used by grape growers and winemakers. The vast majority of these products are not discussed in Chapters 4 to 9 and also, unlike food labelling, they hardly ever feature on wine labels. However, one example that can illustrate the importance of this legislation is SO, SO, is almost universally used in winemaking, but if it is consumed in very high doses it can be toxic. Even though the levels of</p>

            <p>Gls is relatively easy to control within the boundaries a single country because only one legal jurisdiction is involved However, it is less straightforward if a produce in one country decides to label their wine with a G another country. Therefore, over time, the World Trade Organization (the global body that manages international trade agreements) has developed a system for Gls that is now used by all major wine-producing countries. This syste relies on defined boundaries and regional names. This ensures that everyone uses the same approach and as a result it is much easier for individual countries or groups of countries to reach agreements that recognise and respect each other's Gls. For example, 'Chablis was</p>

            <p>SO, found in wine are very small, this chemical's potentially used to label wines by Australian producers. Of course these wines could never have been labelled as such wher sold in the EU but now, as a result of a trade agreement this term can no longer be used in Australia either. In harmful effects on human health means that its use in winemaking is very tightly regulated. In most countries the words 'contains sulfites' must appear on the label if the amount of 50, in a wine is above a certain level. In practice, exchange for more equitable trading arrangements, the a small amount of SO, is produced naturally during</p>

            <p>fermentation so these words are likely to be required even if no 50, is added in the winemaking process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Label Integrity</h2>
            <p>It is the responsibility of the person or company that puts a product on sale that the description of the product and any claims made on the packaging are accurate. This of course means that labelling information needs to be clear and able to be checked. Wine is no exception and there are many dos and don'ts when it comes to wine labelling. However, certain aspects are more important than others. Geographical Indications Geographical indications (Gls) refer to a product's region or place of origin and are a common feature on wine labels. This is because the area where grapes are grown can have a defining influence on the style and quality of the wine. A GI is a designated vineyard area within a country. These areas can be very large and cover an entire region (e.g. Bordeaux) or they can be very small covering no more than a single vineyard (e.g. La Romanée in Burgundy).</p>

            <p>Understandably, the use of Gls is tightly controlled to ensure a wine is genuinely the product of the grapes grown in the location stated on the label. For wines that sell at a premium price, fraud is a very real risk. The use of Australians agreed to recognise and prohibit the use of EU GIs on their labels, The rules and regulations are complex but there are two important points of interest. First, if a Gl is stated o the label then typically at least 85 per cent of the liquid in the bottle must come from the stated Gl. This rule does not apply universally and it is best to see this as a standard from which there is some deviation: some local laws are less strict and others are more strict (for example, for PDO wines 100 per cent of the grapes mus come from the region stated on the label). Similar rules can also apply to vintage dates and grape varieties. Second, there are significant variations between the way that GI legislation is written in the EU and non-EU countries.</p>

            <p>European Union - European Union (EU) wines with a Glare divided into two quality categories, wines with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and wines with a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). Broadly speaking, PDOS are smaller areas with more tightly defined regulations, whereas PGIs are larger and have fewer regulations. Although PDO and PGI are permitted label terms, they rarely appear on the label Instead, producers tend to use long-established traditional labelling terms. For example, Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AC) is used in France instead of the French term for PDO (which is Appellation d'origine protégée)</p>

            <p>That said, the French term for PGI-Indication géographique protégée (IGP) - is increasingly used on labels instead of the traditional term Vin de Pays. European Gls are unique because, typically, local laws will also specify what grape varieties can be grown, and what grape growing and winemaking techniques can be used. By identifying the grape varieties and processes that were used to produce a region's best wines, the system was designed to protect what was seen as the unique identity of local wines, promoting quality and preventing fraud. Therefore, in theory, each PDO produces wines with a unique flavour that cannot be copied by any other wine. This is reinforced by the fact that according to PDO regulations 100 per cent of the grapes must come from the stated region of origin for these wines. Note that many PDO wines do not state the grape variety on the label. This can mean that some of the finest expressions of Chardonnay, for example, come in bottles labelled as Chablis AC or Meursault AC.</p>

            <p>Given that the PDO system is very restrictive, many producers prefer to make wines in the PGI category because it allows the use of non-traditional varieties in the blend (for example Sauvignon Blanc in the south of France) and the rules governing production are less strict. However, local laws are still likely to regulate vine yield and limit production volumes. The PGI category is very diverse and can include wines of exceptional quality made using grapes grown in vineyards that simply fall outside of the PDO boundaries, as well as high-volume inexpensive wines from international grape varieties such as Chardonnay and Merlot. Unlike PDO wines, the grape variety or varieties are usually stated on the label.</p>

            <p>Wine without a GI is the category that offers European producers the most flexible production rules. For example, it allows brand owners to create multi-regional blends by sourcing grapes from vineyards throughout a country, or even multinational blends by sourcing grapes from different countries in the EU. There are no other limits on production beyond those that are necessary for product safety and accurate labelling. The individual regulations for each country and region can be found in their relevant chapter in Section 3 of this book. Non-EU countries - Nearly all non-EU wines in the international market fall into the category of wines with a Gl. Each country has developed its own way of dividing its vineyard areas into Gls. Sometimes political boundaries are used but more frequently vineyards are divided into other more specific areas, such as regions, zones, districts and so on. However, importantly, there are no local laws to define and limit what grape varieties can be planted. Unlike in the EU, the legal terms (such as AVA, Zone or Ward) are rarely seen on the label.</p>

            <p>The individual regulations for each country can also be found in the relevant chapter in Section 3 of this book.</p>

            <h2>Wine And The Law</h2>
            <p>EXAMPLES OF EU AND NON-EU WINE LABELS These two Chardonnay labels, one from Burgundy and the other from California, show the labelling conventions typical of EU and non-EU countries. The Chablis is not varietally labelled and the legal category (here abbreviated to Appellation contrôlée) is clear to see. On the other hand, Chardonnay is prominent on the California label and the term for the legal category, in this case AVA, is not shown.</p>

            <p>Legally Defined Quality and Style Indications There is another set of labelling terms, that has evolved in the EU and been defined by local laws, to indicate both quality and style. These terms are observed by all EU countries. The EU has been keen to limit the extent to which these labelling terms are copied in other countries. For example, Australia has a long tradition of making high-quality fortified wines in a Sherry style. These wine were labelled using Sherry terms such as Fino and Amontillado but this is no longer permitted.</p>

            <p>When consumed in moderation, alcohol is not regarded as harmful to health. However, alcohol can significantly affect the behaviour of anyone who consumes too much (often in very socially unacceptable and dangerous 79</p>

            <p>ways). For some people it can be highly addictive and, when consumed to excess, it can have a very negative impact on both short- and long-term health. In some cultures alcohol is not considered socially acceptable and its consumption is banned as a result. In countries where alcohol consumption is permitted, legislation is used to try and control access to alcohol and limit its potentially harmful effects. Legal controls focus on two areas in particular. First, a minimum legal age is set for both the purchase and consumption of alcohol, These restrictions seek to limit young people's access to alcohol as this age group is considered more vulnerable to its potentially harmful effects.</p>

            <p>Second, there is a legal limit on the amount of alcohol someone can have in their blood when driving a vehicle. This is typically expressed in terms of milligrams of ethanol per millilitres of blood. Alcohol reduces co-ordination, slows reaction times and increases risk-taking. Therefore driving or operating machinery under the influence of alcohol significan increases the risk of injury and death for the operator/driver and those around them.</p>
