        <h1>Canada</h1>

            <p>Canada Canada's most important vineyard regions are situated in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. Its wine regions experience a harsh continental climate but with moderating influences from large bodies of water. Canada produces some world-renowned Icewines. along with steadily growing volumes of dry wines, both white and red.</p>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Wine Regions</h2>
            <p>The climate is continental throughout Canada's wine regions, so although average annual temperatures are low, average daytime temperatures in July and August are often very high. Large lakes go some way to moderate temperature extremes, but the winters are cold and temperatures may drop far below zero for long periods, creating suitable conditions for Icewine production. Ontario Ontario has three primary appellations of which the most important is the Niagara Peninsula on the south- western corner of Lake Ontario. The lake cools down and heats up more slowly than the surrounding land. This extends the growing season in the autumn allowing grapes to ripen fully and delays budburst in the spring helping to minimise frost damage. Air flow helps to reduce fungal disease. Riesling does well here, making fresh, fruity dry and off-dry whites, and the finest Icewines. Another grape variety commonly used for Icewine is Vidal. This hybrid is hardy, and while it has little character when made int a dry white, it can make high-quality Icewines, although without the acid structure and aromatic complexity of those made from Riesling. Good quality dry Chardonnay are also made, generally with pure fruit and restrained oak. Among black grape varieties, Cabernet Franc is the most planted, producing wines with red plum and</p>

            <p>herbal characteristics. It may be used to make single varietal wines or Bordeaux-style blends with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Plantings of Pinot Noir are small but some high-quality wines are being made. British Columbia British Columbia has five primary appellations, the most important of which is the Okanagan Valiey. This huge appellation lies in a rain shadow between two mountain ranges, which results in very low annual average rainfall and a semi-desert environment. Day lengths throughout the growing season are extremely long due to the northern latitude, and this prolongs the time in which photosynthesis can take place, aiding grape ripening. Large glacial lakes help to moderate temperatures and extend the growing season, enabling successful ripening of white grapes in the north and black grapes in the south.</p>

            <p>The most widely planted varieties are Merlot, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Icewine is also produced here, usually from Riesling or Vidal.</p>

            <p>Canada's appellation system is the Vintners Quality Alliance (VQA). Two provinces currently use the VQA scheme: Ontario and British Columbia. Each province has a number of approved appellations and then sub- appellations. Every VQA wine must use 100 per cent grapes that are grown in that province. They must be made 100 per cent from V. vinifera varieties or selected hybrids.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Wires. Explaining Style And</h2>
            <p>Chile Located between the Andes to the east and the Pacific to the west, Chile has an unusual geography. However, it is this geography, which combines cooling influences from the Pacific and Andes along with plentiful sunshine, that explains why Chile has found success making a wide range of wine styles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Climate And Grape Growing</h2>
            <p>Chile's vineyards range over an area that covers more than 900 kilometres from north to south but rarely more than 100 kilometres from east to west. The area is broadly defined by four key geographical features. To the west is the Pacific Ocean and just inland are the coastal mountain ranges. To the east are the Andes, which also mark Chile's border with Argentina. North of Santiago the two ranges tend to merge, but south of the capital there is a large depression between the two mountain ranges that is commonly referred to as the Central Valley, in many places there are gaps in the Coastal Range caused by tiver valleys that drain the water from the Andes. Generally speaking the vineyards of Chile have a warm Mediterranean climate. The dry, sunny growing season ensures that the grapes reliably ripen and fungal diseases are kept to a minimum. In most places the shortfall in rainwater can be made up for with irrigation. However, water for irrigation is in increasingly short supply Conditions become cooler and wetter in the Southem Regions El Niño and La Niña are weather patterns that can affect Chile's wine regions in some years Rainfall levels can dramatically increase during Nino years, whereas drought may occur in La Niña years. This cyclical weather phenomenon is experienced throughout the Pacific,</p>

            <p>Along the north-south axis there are common features that moderate temperatures on the western and eastern edges of vineyard areas. The cold Humboldt Current flows</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Chilean Wine Laws</h2>
            <p>With Cules scheme the vineyard areas are divided into several Denominaciones de Origen (DOS) There are six regional DOS, However, the vast majority of vineyard plantings can be found within four of these Coquimbs Aconcagua, Central Valley and Southern Regis These regions are divided into 13 better known sub-regions that generally follow the valleys running west from the Andes to the Pacific. The system was based on Chilles administrative regions and as sath the regions are very broad based and most of the sub-regions sover extensive tracts of land Consequently many of the sub-regions contain multiple zones, each with a more uniform climate. 2012 further degree of dassification was introduced further deding Chieste regions. This classication categorises vineyard up from Antarctica along the Chilean coast and the prevailing winds blow cool air inland along the river valleys. In areas very close to the coast this can also include fog. The cooling effect of these winds is strongest in the areas where the coastal mountains are at their lowest, and in the parts of the valleys that lie closest to the Pacific in the vineyards in the foothills of the Andes there is another cooling effect caused by cold air that descends from the mountains overnight and can cause a large diurnal temperature range. Between the two mountain ranges the climate is more sheltered and the large expanses of fat land are easier to cultivate. These two cooling influences are the reason additional labelling terms were introduced in 2012 (see section Chilean Wine Laws below).</p>

            <p>Sustainable and organic grape growing and winemaking are widely practised by both large and small wine estates. A number of well-respected winemakers as well as the authorities have done much to promote this. GRAPE VARIETIES AND WINEMAKING Black Grape Varieties Black varieties have always accounted for the majority of the plantings in Chile. Cabernet Sauvignon is the most planted grape variety of either colour. The extent of the plantings means that it is made in a variety of styles from simple and fruity to full-bodied premium examples. These wines usually have very ripe black fruit aromas and flavours, often with a herbaceous character it is frequently blended with Merlot, Carmenère or Syrah. Inexpensive sites according to their distance from the coast rather than their latitude. The following terms may appear on wine labels: Costa for coastal areas), Entre Cordilleras (the areas between the mountain Tanges) and Andes (mountain areas). It is important to note that Costa Entre Cordilleras and Andes are complementary terms that the producer can choose to use in addition to the DO.</p>

            <p>Chilean law also recognises certain other labelling terms Reserv Reserva Especial, Reserva Privada and Gran Reserva. Although loosely defined, these terms carry very little overall meaning but they can be a useful way of communicating the quality levels within a produers portfolio of wines medium-bodied and fruity Merlot has been very successful on export markets, but fuller-bodied, more complex versions can also be found, Carmenère is a late pening variety that is most successful in the warmest and sunniest sites. The wines are usually full-bodied, often with high levels of tannin. Carmenère can have overtly herbaceous aromas when not fully ripe but good examples achieve a balance between black fruit character and herbal aromas. Although the grape is native to Bordeaux, it is no longer widely grown there, and is seen somewhat as a Chilean speciality. Syrah is planted in a wide variety of sites and comes in a variety of styles. Wines hom the cooler coastal or northerly regions such as Elqui Valley are lighter in body with peppery notes, whereas wines from hotter climates, such as Colchagua Valley. display a greater intensity of black fruit flavours and fuller body Pinot Noir is showing considerable promise in cooler locations such as the San Antonio and Casablanca</p>

            <p>Valleys White Grape Varieties Plantings of white varieties in Chile are dominated by two international varieties: Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay Sauvignon Blanc performs particularly well in cooler vineyard sites such as those of the Casablanca and San Antonio Valleys, which yield excellent wines with high acidity and intense fruity favours. The wines tend to focus on ripe apple, citrus and tropical flavours, and sometimes display herbaceous notes. Some examples have added richness and texture from lees stirring and oak. Vineyard areas with cooling influences, particularly Limari Valley, are also increasingly becoming recognised as a source of very good quality Chardonnay The wines tend to show medium to high addity with citrus and stone fruit flavours. Lees stirring and oak fermentation and maturation are often used for texture and flavour. Muscat of Alexandria is the third most planted white variety. It is mostly used for the production of the grape brandy Pisco. There are small plantings of aromatic varieties such as Viognier, Riesling and Gewurztraminer making fresh, fruity wines from cool regions such as the Bio Bio and Itata Valleys.</p>

            <p>REGIONS AND WINES Coquimbo Region Coquimbo borders onto the Atacama Desert and is currently the most northerly of Chile's principal wine regions. There are three winemaking sub-regions here. Elqui Valley, Limari Valley and Choapa Valley. Vineyard plantings are relatively small compared with the more Southerly regions but quality tends to be high. All three valleys have slightly different features but they all benefit from brilliant sunshine and marked cooling influences ither from sea breezes or mountain air. Some vineyards are now being planted at very high altitudes. The biggest Challenge here is the lack of water. Irrigation is essential but expensive because water is less plentiful here compared with some other regions. Nevertheless, Elqui</p>
