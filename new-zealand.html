        <h1>New Zealand</h1>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>New Zealand New Zealand is a wine-producing country that is best known for its fresh, vibrant Sauvignon Blanc, a style that has inspired winemakers in many other wine regions. However, its reputation for making premium-quality Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Syrah and Bordeaux-style blends means that there is far more to New Zealand than one grape variety.</p>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Climate And Grape Growing</h2>
            <p>New Zealand's isolated location in the Pacific Ocean (1900 kilometres from Australia, the nearest land mass) means that it experiences a maritime climate overall. The South Island's climate is cool, whereas that of the North Island is a little warmer. The combination of long sunshine hours, nights cooled by sea breezes and a long ripening period allows grapes to reach high levels of sugar and flavour ripeness while retaining acidity. The vineyards of the South Island tend to be located on the east side, protected from rain-bearing westerly winds by mountains in the centre of the island, however, many of the vineyard areas still experience plentiful rainfall, which can be problematic during ripening. Fortunately the soils tend to be free draining, and so do not experience waterlogging, however, those on flat land</p>

            <h2>New Zealand</h2>
            <p>2 N can be overly fertile, leading to excessive shoot and leaf growth. Due to their problems with vine vigour New Zealand viticulturists have become experts in trellising and other canopy management techniques. The New Zealand wine industry is strongly committed to reducing the environmental impact of their vineyard management and winery practices. Sustainable Winegrowing New Zealand is an initiative that sets winery standards to help growers achieve these aims. GRAPE VARIETIES AND WINEMAKING White Varieties Since the early 1990s, Sauvignon Blanc has been firmly established as New Zealand's flagship grape and it accounts for the majority of wine production. Its pungent aromas, intense flavours of elderflower and passion fruit. and high acidity have set a benchmark for Sauvignon Blanc producers around the world. There are subtle differences between the styles of the North and South Islands, the warmer North produces Sauvignon Blanc with more tropical flavours and the South creates wines with higher acidity and flavours of green bell pepper and gooseberry. It is most frequently fermented in inert vessels at cool temperatures to retain fruity flavours and aromas, but some producers also make oak-matured styles as a point of difference.</p>

            <p>Chardonnay is also widely planted. Similar to many other countries producing wines from this variety, a number of different winemaking techniques may be explored and thus there can be great diversity between wines. However, the general style tends to be led by concentrated citrus and tropical fruits with subtle hints of toast from new French oak. Over recent years New Zealand's producers have been exploring the country's enormous potential for the aromatic varieties Riesling and Gewurztraminer, and the semi-aromatic Pinot Gris. Dry autumns and cool night temperatures ensure aromatic compounds have plenty of time to develop before the grapes are harvested. The wines range from dry to sweet, however off-dry tends to be the most prevalent style.</p>

            <p>Black Varieties Pinot Noir is the second most planted grape variety in New Zealand after Sauvignon Blanc. It is widely grown throughout the South Island and within a few selected sites in the North Island. While the overall profile of New Zealand Pinot Noir is one of vibrant fruit, fine ripe as texture and often quite high levels of distinct regional styles have also emerged. hough its plantings are very limited compared with e of Pinot Noir, Merlot is the red variety with the and greatest volume. Cabernet Sauvignon is often nded to add tannin and notes of cassis, making up der-style blend. Like all the wines from New And these blends are noted for the purity of their favours Production of these varieties is strongly acetated in the North Island, where the warmer peratures help to ripen black grapes. Syrah is another pe variety that performs best in warmer sites and produces elegant wines that are closer in style to those of the one rather than those made in the hotter climates Australia. Its plantings are small but increasing.</p>

            <h2>Regions And Wines: North Island</h2>
            <p>Auckland Auckland was traditionally the heart of the New Zealand wine industry. While many large companies retain their headquarters in the area, production facilities are now nure often in other parts of the country. Auckland is warm and the wettest part of New Zealand and fungal diseases are an issue. Chardonnay, Merlot and Syrah are the most planted varieties. Waiheke Island immediately to the east has a growing reputation for top quality wines, particularly reds Gisborne The vineyards are located on the east coast in the broad estuary plain close to the town of Gisborne itself. Rainfall shigh but so too are the temperatures and sunshine hours in the growing season. By far the most planted grape variety is Chardonnay, which displays distinct ripe topical fruit flavours. A small amount of high-quality Gewurztraminer is also made here, as well as some full- bodied Pinot Gris</p>

            <p>Hawke's Bay This vineyard area, located close to the twin towns of Hastings and Napier, is also situated on the east coast of North Island in an estuary plain. It is the warmest of the main grape growing areas and has the longest sunshine hours. This area, which is second only to Marlborough in the extent of its plantings, is particularly diverse with regard to its soils and the aspect and altitude of the plantings. Consequently wine styles can vary. One area in particular, Gimblett Gravels, which is a parcel of well- drained heat-absorbing gravel soil on the valley floor, has developed a particularly high reputation for black</p>

            <h2>New Zealand'S Wine Laws</h2>
            <p>varieties. Although the region built its fame on Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux-style blends, premium Syrah is also produced. Wairarapa Wairarapa is made up of a number of small vineyard areas spread over a wide area at the southern tip of the North Island. The most important area is around the small town of Martinborough, which has built a global reputation for Pinot Noir and is now a registered Gl. Summer temperatures can be high but a wide diurnal range makes it suitable for this grape variety. The wines are medium-to full-bodied and ripe with hints of dark plum and spice. REGIONS AND WINES: SOUTH ISLAND Marlborough</p>

            <p>This is the major centre for grape growing in New Zealand, and Sauvignon Blanc makes up the majority of the plantings here. Most of the vineyards lie in two adjacent estuary valleys: Wairau, which is by far the largest, and Awatere. The climate in the Wairau Valley is very similar to Martinborough with long sunny days, but this large valley is far from uniform. In particular there are a number of side valleys on the southern side of Wairau Valley that give producers a range of aspects and altitudes to work with. The Awatere Valley is drier, cooler and windier. As a result, the Sauvignon Blancs from here have a higher acidity with a pronounced herbaceous character, and lack the tropical fruit flavours that can be found in some of the wines from the Wairau Valley.</p>

            <p>New Zealand's GI scheme is recently established, with the first Gls registered in 2017. For a wine to be labelled with a Gl a minimum of 85% of the grapes must come from the region to which the Gl relates. New Zealand, North Island and South Island are registered Gls, Gls also include, but are not limited to, each of the major regions detailed in this chapter. Summer pruning taking place in Gimblett Gravels. The stony sail and well- exposed fruit are dear to see. 172 Vineyard is Marlborough planted so the valley flee.</p>
